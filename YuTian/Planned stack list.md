Dear Professor,

I am currently planning a front-end and back-end separated project and would like to seek your advice on the choice of my technical stack. The brief details and considerations are as follows:

**Back-end**: I intend to use the Spring Boot framework, mainly due to its key advantages such as its standalone and production-ready setup, embedded server integration, convention over configuration design philosophy, and ease of dependency management. It also promotes good coding practices and has a vibrant, supportive community.

**Front-end**: React framework is my choice. It has numerous benefits like a robust ecosystem, high flexibility, and better user experience due to its virtual DOM feature. In addition, its component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability.

**Database Framework**: I'm thinking of using the Hibernate framework under the JPA system. It simplifies database access in our application and provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.

**Underlying Database**: I am currently torn between MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB. MySQL is a reliable, well-understood, and efficient relational database. Redis offers high-performance for high transaction processing. MongoDB, with its flexible JSON-like documents, can support diverse data types and is well-suited for hierarchical data storage. I am inclined towards MySQL for its simplicity and well-established practices. However, I am still unsure and contemplating the best fit for my project requirements.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or guidance you could provide on this matter. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
