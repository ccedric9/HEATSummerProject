My detailed suggestions based on the aspects of front-end, back-end, and database:

1、Back-end (Spring Boot) + Front-end (React)：
For back-end web development, if you use java language, the spring framework is essential. The front-end framework chooses react among vue and react, because the latter is used more abroad.
2、Database (JPA or MyBatis)：
It is not yet clear which one should be chosen between mybatis and jpa, both of which can be chosen. In fact, the latter is more difficult for beginners, but it is also more widely used abroad.


The licensing and commercial use of these technologies:
Spring Boot: Spring Boot is open-source and can be used for commercial purposes. Its source code is released under the Apache 2.0 License, which allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the code and also permits its use in commercial projects.

React: React is also open-source and can be used for commercial purposes. It is released under the MIT License, which, similar to the Apache 2.0 License, allows use, modification, and distribution of the code, and also permits its use in commercial projects.

JPA (Java Persistence API): JPA is a part of Java EE standards, is open-source, and can be used for commercial purposes. Specific implementations of JPA (like Hibernate) also have their own open-source licenses, most of which allow commercial use.

MyBatis: MyBatis is open-source and can be used for commercial purposes. Its source code is released under the Apache 2.0 License.
