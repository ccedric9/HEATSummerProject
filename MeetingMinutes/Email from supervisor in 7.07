Hiya Cedric (and everyone else)
 
I’ve recorded the last meeting we had with Joel in the system
However, the forwarded email is relating to “in-person” meetings
We are required to have 2 face-to-face meetings over the summer
It would be a good idea to make the next meeting in-person
My next available on-campus day is Thursday 13th – how does that work for you all ?
 
Simon

Subject: IMPORTANT: Your attendance on your programme of study in June

Student Number: 2236621
Student Name: Zhimeng Chen
Programme: 4COSC005T - Computer Science (MSc)
  
Dear Zhimeng Chen,
  
Your school has let us know that you were marked as absent in June because you did not attend an in-person contact (e.g. supervisor meeting, teaching or assessment).   
 
The attendance of all students is monitored as part of the University Policy for Student Engagement and Attendance, as we want our students to be supported to achieve academic success.    
 
We are also required to monitor the engagement of our international students with their studies as part of our responsibilities to the Home Office (UK Government), in sponsoring students to study at the University of Bristol.   
 
The minimum attendance and engagement requirement for full-time postgraduate taught students undertaking their dissertation over the summer vacation is one in-person contact point per month. 
 
Students studying on distance learning programmes are not permitted to be sponsored for a Student visa. Only in exceptional circumstances can you study your programme from outside the UK, e.g. if you are temporarily absent doing fieldwork or data collection that is integral to your studies and which cannot be completed in the UK.  Please see the visa services Change in study location webpage for further details.  
 
Absences from Bristol must be a requirement of the course or your research; remote study for personal reasons cannot be approved as a change in study location whilst you hold a Student visa.  We are required to notify the UKVI of students who are absent, whether permitted or not, for 2 consecutive months.
 
As you were marked as absent in June you must attend an in-person contact in Bristol in July or we will be required to withdraw your visa sponsorship.  This means you would not be eligible to apply for the Graduate route visa (see also below *).
 
If you are not currently in the UK, please can you confirm the following as soon as possible:
1.      the date you left the UK
2.      the date you plan to return to Bristol or if that you plan to remain overseas to complete your programme 
3.      If you plan to remain overseas, please confirm you have discussed your absence with your supervisor and school/faculty and have their permission to study your course from overseas  
 
If you are permitted to study from home for longer than 60 days and this is not required by your course, we are required by UKVI to withdraw the sponsorship of your Student visa.  You will need a new visa if you want to come back to the UK for graduation.  Please see the Attending your graduation webpage for further information or contact the Student Visas team for advice: student-visa-advice@bristol.ac.uk.  
 
You may have also received emails regarding your absence from your School or Faculty. We encourage you to engage with all communications fully.  Please do let your School know if there are any issues that may be causing you concern. As an institution, we want to ensure we do everything we can to support you in succeeding in your studies. Your school and faculty teams are there to help, and your Personal Tutor, Supervisor or Senior Tutor can help with both academic and personal support. See the also the Student Support and Well-being webpages for more information:  https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/ 
 
 * IMPORTANT: Please note that you can only be successful in your application for the Graduate Route visa if you hold a valid Student visa at the time of your degree award being made.  To be eligible for the Graduate Route visa you must also meet the Study in the UK requirement: you must have studied in the UK for at least 12 months of your course if the course is longer than 12 months, or the entire duration of the course if it is 12 months or less.  Further information about the Graduate Route can be found on the following webpages: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/after-study/graduate-route/ and https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/Information--Advice/Working/Graduate-route.
