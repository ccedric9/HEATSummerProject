It’s getting better
Might be worth a final filtering – go through the questions an ask yourselves:
Do we need to ask this question and does it give you any useful information on the objectives of the project ?
Just so you can minimise the number of questions participants have to complete

Hi Simon,
 
Thank you for your feedback on the survey. Your insights were really helpful, and I've made the changes accordingly.
Here's the updated survey:

We'd appreciate your thoughts on the revised version.
 
Many thanks,
Team

Hiya Team,
 
The questionnaire is generally OK, just a few comments
“easy to navigate”: might be an idea to break this down into a number of questions focusing on different elements/tasks/paths through the system – often some activities are easy, and others are harder – it’s difficult for users to answer this kind of “for the whole system”
 
“incongruous and jarring”: if the user responded “strongly agree” how would you fix the problem (you don’t know what was jarring)
 
“accuracy and reliability” depends a lot on the data that is in the system (what Joel, the school office and I give you) rather than being a feature of your system
 
“meets my needs for checking information”: user’s might not know there needs (they often don’t) might be better to ask if the system allowed them to check the information they were asked to check. You could add a follow-up question to ask if they could imagine any other types of information they might need to find out (and ask what that information might be – again, you can’t improve if you don’t know what they actually want)
 
“readability”: more than one question is being asked here – split into multiple questions “Desktop readability”, “Desktop navigation”, “Mobile readability”, “Mobile Navigation”
 
“Loading speed”: again, not really you fault/problem. If it’s slow then it the hosting service (rather than something in the code you need to fix)
 
Writing questionnaires is tricky ;o)

Subject: HEAT Team Evaluation Survey

Hiya Simon,
 
Just a quick heads-up: our survey is all set to go!
We took a cue from the SUS (System Usability Survey) to put it together, here's the link:
https://forms.office.com/e/sjWDznTRKP
 
Could you spare a moment to take a look? Your thoughts and suggestions would be really helpful. We're open to feedback on the questions, structure – basically everything.
 
Thanks a lot for your time and support.
 
All the best,
Team
